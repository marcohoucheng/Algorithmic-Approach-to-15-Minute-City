In the previous section \ref{previous_works}, serveral studies have discussed the needs for standardisation in terms of the methodogy used in computing the 15-Minute City. In particular, Pezzica et al. argued that \say{the absence of standardised modelling protocols imposes significant limitations on the application of MC models, hinders synchronic comparisons, and can indirectly foster the formulation of exclusive policies and inconsistent planning decisions} \cite{Pezzica_Altafini_Mara_Chioni_2024}. Lima et al. noted that \say{introducing computational approaches to 15-minute city design presents significant challenges and potential bottlenecks. On the other hand, exploring these challenges as opportunities for inserting new research is also possible since the theme is rising}, some of these challenges are “Data availability and quality”, “Computational cost” and “Adaptability” \cite{lima_quest_2023}. Furthermore, Marchigiani et al. found that the approach to 15-Minute City needs to be changed and adapted to each location case by case \cite{marchigiani_urban_2022}.

With these in mind, the aim of this thesis is to provide a general, adaptable algorithm to identify the 15-Minute City, where a person can travel to all their needs within 15 minutes from their home. Formally, the algorithm has the following properties.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Inputs
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A graph data structure $G(V,E)$ representing the entire area of which t-Minute City is computed, where $V$ is the set of vertices representing road junctions, $E$ is the set of weighted, undirected edges such that $E\subseteq V\times V$ and the weights of the edges are proportional to the length of the roads, in minutes.
        \item Given a list of services of $n$ distinct types and their locations, each location is inserted into the graph by adding a vertex to $V$ along an existing edge in $E$. The vertex should be inserted in such a way that the distance from the vertex to the nearest road junction is minimised.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Output
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[o] A set of vertices reachable by at least one location of each service type within $t$ minutes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Notes:} Barbieri et al. proposed to use a planar graph \cite{barbieri_graph_2023}. However, it is not clear if a planar graph would be able to represent bridges/tunnels etc effectively, as the definition of a planar graph is that it can be drawn on the plane in such a way that its edges intersect only at their endpoints.
