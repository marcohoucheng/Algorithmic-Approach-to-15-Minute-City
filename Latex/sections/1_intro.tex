The 15-Minute City was first proposed by Moreno in 2016 as a solution to build safer, more resilient, sustainable and inclusive cities and to harmonise the notion of Smart Cities \cite{moreno_introducing_2021}. Since COVID-19 pandemic, this topic has gained a tremendous amount of attention and has growth exponentially in popularity \cite{lima_quest_2023,allam_theoretical_2022} among various research fields in literature, with urban design being the most studied \cite{lima_quest_2023}. The concept of the 15-Minute City has been studied and shown that it brings benefits to the society (environmental, social, and economical etc.) \cite{allam_theoretical_2022}.

However, many of the studies in 15-Minute City (or $t$ minute city in general) in the literature have used a data-driven approach. Although the 15 minutes threshold is attracted the most attention, the notion of the $t$-Minute City has also been considered \cite{moreno_introducing_2021}. Some examples are the 20-Minute City in Tempe, Arizona \cite{capasso_da_silva_accessibility_2019}, the 30-Minute City in Sydney, Australia \cite{sarkar_measuring_2020} and Olivari et al. studied 5 to 60 Minute City in Ferrara, Italy \cite{olivari_are_2023}. The lack of algorithmic approaches available regarding $t$ minute city means that many solutions available cannot be generalised and to be reapplied to another location of interest. Moreover, Lima et al. has noted that computational approaches to 15-Minute City design presents significant challenges such as “data availability and quality”, “computational cost” and “adaptability” \cite{lima_quest_2023}. Notably, Weng et al. \cite{weng_15-minute_2019} and Olivari et al.\cite{olivari_are_2023} relied on census data on population density for their respective studies which may not be available for some countries and regions.
