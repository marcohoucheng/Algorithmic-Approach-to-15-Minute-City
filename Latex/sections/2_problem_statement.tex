The aim of this thesis is to provide a general, adaptable algorithm to identify the 15-Minute City, where a person can travel to all their needs within 15 minutes.

Formally, given an area of interest and a list of services, the algorithm should determine the area within which a person can travel to any of these services within 15 minutes. The selection of services in the algorithm should be arbitrary as the 15-Minute City concept might have different interpretation and needs for different cities \cite{marchigiani_urban_2022}. Therefore, the set of services here should be generalised and be determined by the user depending on the context and the requirement.
