The concept of the 15-Minute City has been a popular topic in literature since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. It was first proposed by Moreno in 2016 as a solution to build safer, more resilient, sustainable and inclusive cities. The goal of this project is to develop and provide a general, adaptable algorithm to identify the 15-Minute City, where a person can travel to all their needs within 15 minutes.
