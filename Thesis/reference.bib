	abstract = {We studied the structure of the 15-minute city by measuring the distances from the services on spatial graphs. While the concept of the 15-minute city is rapidly spreading, its operative deﬁnition can be of help for planning and understanding the possibilities of the general idea. For three European cities (Rome, Paris, and London), we developed a method to calculate pedestrian travel time to reach services for all the possible paths on urban graphs, ﬁnding that the 15-minute city generally has multiple connected components and that the services have not necessarily been part of it. This algorithm was used to to make a quantitative comparison between the cities, showing that Paris and London have a stronger 15-minute characterization than Rome. By generalizing the method, it was possible to deﬁne a 15-minute urban index, which quantitatively characterizes this city feature. The results seem to be promising because, at the cost of the massive use of computational time, a digital model for the city can be generated: a planning tool to simulate urban solutions and a rigorous criterion for evaluating how much a city can be considered a 15-minute city.},

This vision takes concrete form in the concept of the 15-minute city model, focused on pedestrian accessibility from one's home to nearby urban services and spaces. In this perspective, the paper aims at exploring the theme of 15-minute cities through a GIS-based model to evaluate pedestrian accessibility to neighbourhood facilities. The implemented methodology integrates the assessment of walking distances, considering the time factor as crucial, and mapping the resident population. The method is then applied to measure the current performances of an existing neighbourhood in Parma from the 15 minutes city perspective, assessing accessibility based on home-facility travel times and the resident population distribution within reach. A reflection is proposed on what has been learned and on the possible contribution that the method can bring to monitoring the 15-minute city and to urban planning.},

Complementary to other approaches like infrastructure improvements, increases in residential density, or traffic calming measures, here, we show how planning for walkability can be augmented by the adaptation of tools and approaches from the study of urban networks, by privileging the pedestrian perspective of short-distance access over the car (and rapid transit) perspective of flow and efficiency. Using a recently developed sidewalk network model that moves towards a more realistic rep­ resentation of the pedestrian environment, we propose a framework for assessing multi-factor walkability using percolation theory and insights into pedestrian behavior. We apply our framework to the city of Barcelona, and show how it can be used to optimize service location and access for vulnerable populations (the elderly and young).},

	abstract = {Providing pedestrian accessibility to urban services is a big challenge and a key factor in creating more walkable urban areas. Moreover, it is a critical aspect of climate-resilient urban planning as it is broadly assumed that neighborhoods with greater walkability discourage automobile use and reduce CO2 emissions. The idea of 15-minute cities, deﬁned as urban environments where most places that residents need to access are within a 15-minute walk, is gaining increasing attention worldwide. Because aspects of urban performance are increasingly quantiﬁable, generative, and data-driven design approaches can explore broader sets of potential solutions, while optimization can help identify designs with desired properties. This work demonstrates and tests a new approach that combines shape grammars, a formal method for shape generation that facilitates the elaboration of complex patterns and meaningful solutions, with multi-objective optimization. The goal was to optimize the design of urban fabric layouts and the location of amenities to provide 15-minute neighborhood conﬁgurations that minimize infrastructure cost (as estimated by cumulative street length) and the number of amenities, while maximizing pedestrian accessibility to urban services (as assessed by overall integration and the average distance from all plots to nearest amenities).},

	abstract = {The concept of the 15-minute city has gained growing attention as a sustainable urban development model aimed at improving people's quality of life while reducing environmental footprint from urban transport demand. Effectively implementing this concept requires urban analysists and planners to assess the distribution of urban functions and propose actions that promote equitable access to services within a reasonable commuting time, primarily using soft mobility modes. However, there is currently no consensus on modelling principles and methods for producing reliable minute-city representations. Additionally, there is uncertainty about the spatial, positional, configurational, and socioeconomic parameters to consider in such models. This paper starts to address this significant knowledge gap by tackling the often-overlooked issue of examining the implications of technical modelling decisions on minute-city evaluations based on an isochrone analysis. One such choice is selecting an ideal point from which to calculate the 15-minute travel radius, as it determines the area where functional centres should be located. The paper conducts a sensitivity test on selected key steps of a typical 15-minute city modelling process, using Rome as an illustrative case. The results shed light on the impact of technical decisions on the outcomes of the 15-minute city analysis. This study provides initial insights and recommendations for developing more robust 15-minute city models. It emphasises the importance of technical modelling steps in determining the mapping outputs which support the assessments of 15-minute cities.},

The concept, offering a novel perspective of “chrono-urbanism”, adds to existing thematic of Smart Cities and the rhetoric of building more humane urban fabrics, outlined by Christopher Alexander, and that of building safer, more resilient, sustainable and inclusive cities, as depicted in the Sustainable Development Goal 11 of the United Nations.

Discussion and conclusions highlight critical issues and potentials of the 15-Minute City. If the threat is that of a simpliﬁed and rhetorical use of this idea, its ability to gather plural actions under an appealing ﬂagship can be a powerful driver for urban regeneration policies.

	abstract = {A suﬃcient number of studies have highlighted that walkable neighborhoods can help to reduce the risk of obesity and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The Chinese government advocates the 15-minute (15-min) walkable neighborhoods to provide citizens with 15-min walkable access to basic public services, and ultimately to improve walking behavior and overall health. Following the Walk Score metric, this paper proposes a modiﬁed method for measuring 15-min walkable neighborhoods and applies it to Shanghai, China. Based on amenity access, the assessment considers walking demands of diﬀerent pedestrian groups (i.e., the entire population, children, adults, and seniors), the amenity attributes (scale and category), and the real traﬃc conditions. Spatial regression is further performed to determine whether signiﬁcant associations exist between community socioeconomic status and 15-min walkable neighborhoods score. Results show clear variations in 15-min walkable neighborhoods score for diﬀerent pedestrian groups. Regarding the overall 15-min walkable neighborhoods, highly walkable communities are primarily concentrated in the central areas; and that poorly walkable communities are dispersed in rural areas. Senior-concentrated and adult-concentrated communities are more likely to present higher walkability, while children-concentrated communities exhibit lower walkability. Moreover, communities with inferior walkability are characterized by a high proportion of ﬂoating population (nonresidents). This research provides future studies with references for evaluating 15-min walkable neighborhoods. Social inequalities in 15-min walkable neighborhoods should be emphasized, and interventions in planning implementation for building healthy communities in China should be targeted.},

The escalating rate of urbanization, coupled with the climate emergency, fundamentally indeed disrupt the challenges that urbanism research and practice deal with, calling for adopting more innovative approaches to urban planning and design. With cities contributing around 65\% of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and experiencing an unprecedented growth of population, contemporary urban policy needs to be redeﬁned and re-assessed accordingly. While numerous urban models, such as the Compact City, the Eco-City, the Sustainable City, and the Smart City, have emerged in response to the challenges of sustainability and urbanization, the 15-Minute City has recently gained a steep popularity. This paper explores the theoretical, practical, and technological foundations of the 15-Minute City, with a particular focus on the proximity dimension of mixed land-use and its environmental, social, and economic beneﬁts of sustainability as supported by smart technologies. We argue that this evolving model of urbanism has the potential to gain more expansion and success in regard to building more sustainable, efﬁcient, resilient, equitable, and inclusive cities in line with the global agendas of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, as it adds a strategic value to the amalgam of the prevailing and emerging paradigms of urbanism and their synergies with respect to increasing the beneﬁts of sustainability while emphasizing its environmental dimension.},

The core premise of the concept is that critical urban services and amenities should be reachable within 15 min of walking or cycling from a residence. The urbanplanning principles that enable the realization of the 15-minute city variably embody planning in mixed-use neighborhood units, proximity-based planning, planning for active transport, citizen participation in planning, and innovation and intelligence-driven planning. We revisit these urbanplanning premises in the light of emerging social, physical, and structural developments through 2030, with a focus on European cases. The ﬁndings provide important additions and recommendations to the urban-planning principles of 15-minute cities along the themes of proximity-based planning, the use of land and urban form, urban governance and citizen participation, and inclusive digitalization. The paper moves the discussion on the 15-minute city forward and will be helpful for urban planners, policymakers, and scholars seeking to envision and create a more sustainable, inclusive, and vibrant future in cities.},

	abstract = {Cities can enhance their sustainability planning by prioritizing accessibility as a performance metric for transportation planning. In this context, accessibility measures the ease of reaching opportunities and captures more characteristics of sustainable cities than the more conventionally used mobility metrics, focusing on the overall ability to move and generally recommending faster speeds to overcome distance. However, how cities can prioritize accessibility in planning is understudied. This research presents a case of Tempe, Arizona, putting accessibility into practice through a 20-min lens. Using a 20-min threshold for all modes, the city aims to promote travel for daily activities that is less reliant on private autos. The analysis presented here documents the challenges that planners face when planning for accessibility. The challenges range from technical points to decisions that need to be made about the quality of the built environment. The analysis also shows that Tempe, which is a classically suburban city of wide roads and single-family homes that was built around the automobile, is highly accessible by a 20-min metric by bicycling, walking and transit. These results suggest that planners focus on street network improvements that prioritize accessibility as part of a sustainability strategy.},

In addition to practical exercise, researchers have paid attention to the evaluation of 15-minute cities using home-based accessibility approaches. However, existing approaches do not account for human mobility, an important indicator of how people access and interact with urban amenities. In this study, we propose a novel network-based framework that assesses a 15-minute city considering human mobility patterns. We assume that there exists an optimal mobility network, which would maximize human mobility under the constraints of the current distribution of amenities. Locations where the provision of urban amenities does not match local needs are ﬁrst identiﬁed based on the comparison between optimal mobility patterns and their actual counterparts. Built environment, demographic, and network structure factors that contribute to identiﬁed mismatch issues are then examined. The empirical study of Nanjing, China, suggests that the proposed framework could enable a dynamic evaluation of 15-minute cities and could provide important insights on policies and intervention strategies of planning and developing 15-minute cities.},

	abstract = {Background: Walk Score recently has been demonstrated as a valid and reliable tool for estimating access to nearby facilities, a critical component of the physical activity environment. It has not yet been determined whether Walk Score relates to other critical components of the physical activity environment, including street connectivity, access to public transit, residential density, and crime.
Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between Walk Score and objective/ subjective measures of the physical activity environment.
Methods: Walk Scores were calculated for residential addresses of 296 participants of two RCTs (2006 –2009). Street connectivity, residential density, access to public transit provisions, and crime were objectively measured (GIS) and cross-referenced with Walk Scores and participant’s perceptions of the environment (e.g., perceived crime, access to physical activity facilities, perceived neighborhood walkability). Pairwise Pearson correlations were calculated in March 2010 to compare Walk Score to subjective/objective measures of neighborhood walkability.
Results: Signifıcant positive correlations were identifıed between Walk Score and several objective (e.g., street connectivity, residential density and access to public transit provisions) and subjective (e.g., summed score of the physical activity environment) measures of the physical activity environment. However, positive correlations also were observed between Walk Score and crime.
Conclusions: Collectively, these fındings support Walk Score as a free, easy-to-use, and quick proxy of neighborhood density and access to nearby amenities. However, positive associations between Walk Score and reported crime highlight a limitation of Walk Score and warrant caution of its use.

	abstract = {Background Proximity to walkable destinations or amenities is thought to inﬂuence physical activity behaviour. Previous efforts attempting to calculate neighbourhood walkability have relied on self-report or time-intensive and costly measures. Walk Score is a novel and publicly available website that estimates neighbourhood walkability based on proximity to 13 amenity categories (eg, grocery stores, coffee shops, restaurants, bars, movie theatres, schools, parks, libraries, book stores, ﬁtness centres, drug stores, hardware stores, clothing/music stores).
Objective The purpose of this study is to test the validity and reliability of Walk Score for estimating access to objectively measured walkable amenities.
Methods Walk Scores of 379 residential/ non-residential addresses in Rhode Island were manually calculated. Geographic information systems (GIS) was used to objectively measure 4194 walkable amenities in the 13 Walk Score categories. GIS data were aggregated from publicly available data sources. Sums of amenities within each category were matched to address data, and Pearson correlations were calculated between the category sums and address Walk Scores.
Results Signiﬁcant correlations were identiﬁed between Walk Score and all categories of aggregated walkable destinations within a 1-mile buffer of the 379 residential and non-residential addresses. Test–retest reliability correlation coefﬁcients for a subsample of 100 addresses were 1.0.
Conclusion These results support Walk Score as a reliable and valid measure of estimating access to walkable amenities. Walk Score may be a convenient and inexpensive option for researchers interested in exploring the relationship between access to walkable amenities and health behaviours such as physical activity.},

	abstract = {Polycentricity, or the number of central urban places, is commonly measured by location-based metrics (e.g. employment density/total number of workers, above a threshold). While these metrics are good indicators of location ‘centricity’, results are sensitive to threshold choice. We consider the alternative idea that a centre’s status depends on its connectivity to other locations through trip inflows/outflows: this is inherently a network rather than place idea. Three flow and network-based centricity metrics for measuring metropolitan area polycentricity using journeyto-work data are presented: (a) trip-based; (b) density-based; and (c) accessibility-based. Using these measures, polycentricity is computed and rank-centricity distributions are plotted to test Zipf-like or Christaller-like behaviours. Further, a percolation theory framework is proposed for the full origin–destination matrix, where trip flows are used as a thresholding parameter to count the number of sub-centres. Trip flows prove to be an effective measure to count and hierarchically organise metropolitan areas and sub-centres, tackling the arbitrariness of defining any threshold on employment statistics to count sub-centres. Applications on data from the Greater Sydney region show that the proposed framework helps to characterise polycentricity and subregional organisation more robustly, and provide unexpected insights into the connections between land use, labour market organisation, transport and urban structure.},

	abstract = {At the moment, urban mobility research and governmental initiatives are mostly focused on motor-related issues, e.g. the problems of congestion and pollution. And yet, we cannot disregard the most vulnerable elements in the urban landscape: pedestrians, exposed to higher risks than other road users. Indeed, safe, accessible, and sustainable transport systems in cities are a core target of the UN’s 2030 Agenda. Thus, there is an opportunity to apply advanced computational tools to the problem of traffic safety, in regards especially to pedestrians, who have been often overlooked in the past. This paper combines public data sources, large-scale street imagery and computer vision techniques to approach pedestrian and vehicle safety with an automated, relatively simple, and universally-applicable data-processing scheme. The steps involved in this pipeline include the adaptation and training of a Residual Convolutional Neural Network to determine a hazard index for each given urban scene, as well as an interpretability analysis based on image segmentation and class activation mapping on those same images. Combined, the outcome of this computational approach is a fine-grained map of hazard levels across a city, and an heuristic to identify interventions that might simultaneously improve pedestrian and vehicle safety. The proposed framework should be taken as a complement to the work of urban planners and public authorities.},

For this purpose, all walking speed measurements available in the literature were collected and reviewed. Using this data, the parameter values for different influences were computed and grouped according to their strength, which enables to determine the most important measurement parameters in future walking speed experiments. In addition, standardised measurement conditions are proposed which would provide a baseline for future studies and thus enhance their scientific value.

	abstract = {Background  Walking outdoors can be used by many individuals to meet public health guidelines for moderate-to-vigorousintensity physical activity. The speed at which adults walk may be a proxy for intensity. Traditional estimates of indoor walking speed are unlikely to reflect self-selected usual or other instructed paces of outdoor walking speed.
Objective  To inform estimates of pace-based walking speed of apparently healthy adults in outdoor settings.
Methods  We searched four electronic databases for articles published in English between January 1970 and March 2019. Studies that reported walking speed (m/s), cadence (steps/min), or intensity (mL/kg/min) of ambulatory, apparently healthy, and community-dwelling adults ({\textgreater} 18 years) were included. Walking speed categories were defined according to the description provided in each study. Meta-analysis was used to synthesise speed, cadence, and intensity data by slow, usual, medium, fast, and maximal pace (where reported).
Results  Thirty-five studies, representing 14,015 participants (6808 women, 5135 men, and 2072 sex not specified), were identified. The mean (95\% CI) walking speed for slow, usual, medium, fast, and maximal pace was 0.82 (0.77–0.86), 1.31 (1.27–1.35), 1.47 (1.44–1.49), 1.72 (1.64–1.81), and 1.62 (1.45–1.79) m/s, respectively. Mean cadence (95\% CI) for usual and fast paces were 116.65 (114.95–118.35) and 126.75 (121.87–131.63) steps/min, respectively. The mean oxygen consumption (95\% CI) for the usual and medium paces was 11.97 (11.69–12.25) and 13.34 (12.94–13.73) mL/kg/min, respectively.
Conclusion  These findings provide greater clarity with regard to how various indicators of enacted walking pace, speed, and intensity overlap and how each can be best communicated in the real-world setting to optimise health-related outcomes. Pace-based instructions can be used to support walking in outdoor settings within public health guidelines.},

We tested the hypothesis that walking would be most expensive for obese women compared with obese men and normal-weight women and men. Furthermore, we hypothesized that for all groups, preferred walking speed would correspond to the speed that minimized the gross energy cost per distance. We measured body composition, maximal oxygen consumption, and preferred walking speed of 39 (19 class II obese, 20 normal weight) women and men. We also measured oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production while the subjects walked on a level treadmill at six speeds (0.50–1.75 m/s). Both obesity and sex affected the net metabolic rate (W/kg) of walking. Net metabolic rates of obese subjects were only ∼10\% greater (per kg) than for normal-weight subjects, and net metabolic rates for women were ∼10\% greater than for men. The increase in net metabolic rate at faster walking speeds was greatest in obese women compared with the other groups. Preferred walking speed was not different across groups (1.42 m/s) and was near the speed that minimized gross energy cost per distance. Surprisingly, mass distribution (thigh mass/body mass) was not related to net metabolic rate, but body composition (\% fat) was ( r2 = 0.43). Detailed biomechanical studies of walking are needed to investigate whether obese individuals adopt novel energy saving mechanisms during walking.},
