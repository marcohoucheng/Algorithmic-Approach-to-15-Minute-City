Thesis
- Why time instead of distance
- Lack of complexity studies
- Can be extended to support directed graphs

Extend
- Algorithms studied and why it is not adaptable
- Experiments
-- How was data captured
-- Potential problems (with data quality)
-- Compare cities or repeat existing studies

Presentation
- Complexity
- Search from service locations
- Why time instead of distance
